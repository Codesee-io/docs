# Generic setup instructions

Follow these instructions if your project doesn't use one of the other specific frameworks listed.

## Configure your project

1. If you don't have [Babel compilation](https://babeljs.io/) set up in your app, you need to add it. Use [Babel's excellent guide](https://babeljs.io/setup) for getting set up in your environment.
1. Once you've added your Babel setup, add the `codesee` plugin for development. For example, if you have a `.babelrc` file, add the following to the `env` -> `development` part of your config (`env` goes at the top level):

```json
  "env": {
    "development": {
      "plugins": [
        ["@codesee/instrument", { "hosted": true }],
        /* ... other dev plugins ... */
      ]
    },
  }
```

If your project doesnâ€™t include a Babel config file (for example, `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js`), you may have a Babel configuration in your `webpack.config.js` file that you can add the `["@codesee/instrument", { "hosted": true }]` to. Look for an options block where your Babel settings, presets, and plugins are declared. Add `["@codesee/instrument", { "hosted": true }]` to the list of your project's plugins as in the example below:

```json
   options: {
      presets: [
        //your project's babel presets go here
      ],
      plugins: [
        ["@codesee/instrument", { "hosted": true }],
        //other babel plugins go here
      ],
    },
```


## Optional Config for Large or High Data Applications:

If you have a large, enterprise or high data application, we recommend to set the data verbosity to `false`. By default data verbosity is set to true. 


```
"plugins": [
   ["@codesee/instrument", { "hosted": true, "verbose": false }],
   /* ... other dev plugins ... */
]
```
