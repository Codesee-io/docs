# Overview

CodeSee helps development teams visually understand how your large scale codebase works, document it and collaborate continuously.

**CodeSee is early beta software**, so thank you so much for trying it out, and please let us know (<a href="mailto:support@codesee.io">support@codesee.io</a>) what you think, or how we can help!

## Get started with CodeSee
By integrating CodeSee with your app, you will be able to make and view recordings of the inner workings of your Javascript or Typescript application.

Once installed, whenever you run your app in development and view it in your browser, you should see a circle with the CodeSee logo.

- If it's red, click it to log into CodeSee
- If it's purple, you're ready to go! Click it to start recording, interact with your app, then click it again to stop recording.

## Tips on using CodeSee

- Keep recordings as short as possible -- focus on the one thing you want to understand better.
- When you finish recording, CodeSee will open a new tab with your recording in it as soon as all the data has been transmitted. For larger recordings or on slower networks, there can be some buffering, so please give it a few seconds or more to finish sending the recording to our servers.
- If it delays for long enough, your pop-up blocker may decide to block it. Keep an eye out for that if the codesee site isn't coming up. If in doubt, you can always go to [app.codesee.io/library](https://app.codesee.io/library) to see all your latest recordings.
- The CodeSee UI can be a little sluggish with larger recordings! Sorry about that! For the moment, we ask that you give our UI a second to process now and then. But fear not, we take performance very seriously and we're actively working on performance improvements.
