# Introduction to CodeSee

_**Note: CodeSee is early beta software**. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@codesee.io">support@codesee.io</a> with support questions, feedback, or feature requests._

CodeSee is a tool for developers and development teams. It enables you to visualize how your code works, document your understanding, and share this knowledge with others.

## How CodeSee works

</p>

Once you install CodeSee in your codebase, you can make recordings of the inner workings of your application.

When you run your app locally with CodeSee installed, youâ€™ll see a button with the CodeSee logo. Click the CodeSee button to start recording, then interact with your app. When you want to stop recording, click the button again.

CodeSee creates a visual execution map called a **Data Flow** where you can explore all the code that ran in execution order, inspect runtime data, traverse looping operations, and see important side effects like network requests and responses.

You also get a summarized view of the code in the **Overview** tab. You can note your thoughts and connect commentary directly to the code in the Data Flow using a feature called **Stories**.

CodeSee currently works with JavaScript and TypeScript web applications, and can record data flows on both the frontend and backend (experimental). By default, recordings from your app are hosted securely by CodeSee to be viewed from the web. See [CodeSee Local](local/local) for instructions on hosting your own CodeSee instance.
