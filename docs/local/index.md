CodeSee Local allows you to install CodeSee onto your own servers. This means that when users run CodeSee in their projects, recordings are uploaded to your servers, rather than CodeSee's.

This section provides information on installing and managing CodeSee. For guidance on using CodeSee in your projects, refer to [Installing CodeSee in your project](../install/installation). Documentation on using CodeSee to make and share recordings is available in [Using CodeSee](../use/quick-start).
