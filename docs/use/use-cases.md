# Use cases

CodeSee is a tool to help you read, understand, write, or share, code - whether you are working on a personal project you haven't touched in a year, debugging code at work, or getting up to speed in your first week at a new job.

Here are a few use cases that have helped developers get up to speed quickly and feel more confident in their implementation decisions.

* When you are starting a new task in an unfamiliar part of the codebase and you need to quickly identify the parts of the codebase that are involved in your task, create a Data Flow to see how that part of the codebase works.
* While you are learning something new about a codebase, add a story to your Data Flow to capture your understanding, so you don't have to code-dive again.
* When a teammate has a question about the code and you know the answer, use a Data Flow or story to share your understanding.
* When you've built a feature that others will likely need in the future, use recordings and Stories to share your understanding with the team.
* Attach a shared story or Data Flow to your pull request to share with your teammates.
* Use a shared story or Data Flow with QA as a way to replicate bugs and issues in the codebase.
