## CodeSee compatibility

### Browsers
Currently, for CodeSee to work properly, you'll need to be running your application in Chrome.

### Third-Party Cookies
Unfortunately, if third-party cookies are blocked, our authentication process does not work.

If you have disabled cross-site cookies, you'll need to add the following to the "allow these sites to always use cookies" list in Chrome settings to get CodeSee to work:

```
app.codesee.io
