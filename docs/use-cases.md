# Ways to use CodeSee

CodeSee is a tool to help you read, understand, write, or share code, whether you are working on a personal project you havenâ€™t touched in a year, debugging code at work, or getting up to speed your first week at a new job.

Here are a few use cases that have helped developers get up to speed quickly and feel more confident in their implementation decisions.

1. When you are starting a new task, in an unfamiliar part of the codebase and you need to quickly identify the parts of the codebase that are involved in your task, create a data flow and summary of how that part of the codebase works. You will be able to see an overview and every line of code that ran along with its data values.
2. When you need to write code quickly, you want to deeply understand how the relevant parts of the codebase interact with each other in order to be confident that the decisions that you made are the right ones. Create a recording of your code to see a component diagram to visually show how all of the parts interact with each other (Coming Soon)
3. While you are learning something new about codebase, you want to capture your understanding in a way that's easy to find and refer to later... so you don't have to code-dive again.
4. Once you have a gathered and have assembled a plan for your task, you want to use that information in order to write the new feature or fix the bug. 
5. When you have a question about the code, you want to get an answer from a colleague quickly and easily  so you can get back to work.
6. When a teammate has a question about the code and you know the answer, you want to share your understanding with them quickly and effectively, so they don't need to ask again in the future and they can get unblocked, and you are interrupted less.
7. When you've built a feature (or otherwise have built up an understanding) that others will likely need in the future, you want to share you understanding in a permanent way that will stay up-to-date through changes, so you not a blocker, and your memory is not the only source of knowledge. (Coming Soon)
8. When your feature is complete, you want to create a pull request that includes your understanding, decisions and changes for your new feature so that my teammates can quickly grokk my understanding. (Coming Soon)
