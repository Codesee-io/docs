# Overview: Installing CodeSee in your project

This section describes how to install CodeSee into your project. The instructions assume you have an existing project that you want to add CodeSee to.

Following these instructions, you will:

1. Install two npm packages.
2. Configure Babel so that CodeSee instruments your code when running in development.
3. Rebuild and run your app locally.
